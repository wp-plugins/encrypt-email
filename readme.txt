= Future Features =
* In a future release there will be a TinyMCE button which will allow you to simply highlight your email in the content and wrap it in the shortcode which will encrypt it. For now you'll have to simply type it.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
 
= Does this plugin work with newest WP version and also older versions? =
Yes, this plugin works really fine with WordPress 3 upwards!
 
= Will this work in my theme's widget areas? =
As long as the theme has enabled shortcodes in your sidebar / widgets then this method will work. However, if the widget is already inserting the <a href="mailto: "></a> link then this shortcode won't work in such fields. You'll notice upon saving the widget then it removes everything after the first " sign.
